Model Stacking:
------------------

Three competing models:
	1) XGboost
	2) Random Forest
	3) LASSO with multnomial link function
	
1) Create meta_training data, for second layer
		- All training samples
		- Ground truth label
		- Important features (maybe)
			- Let's start with just fitting model to 15 predictions 
				- 3 models x 5 predictions each
		- Placeholders for predictions from 
2) Create meta_test data in same fashion as meta_training
	- Same samples as full test sset
3) Split training data into folds, k = 5
	- Choose test fold
	- Use other 4 folds as training folds
	- For each model, train on 4 training folds, make predictions onto test fold
	- store prediction in meta-training
4) Fit each model to full training data, make prediction onto test data set. Store predictions in meta_test
5) Fit a final (stacking) model to meta_train, using predictions as features
	- Logistic regression?
